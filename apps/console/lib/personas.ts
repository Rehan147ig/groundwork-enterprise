// The console mints a signed JWT with sub=<persona id> and sends it as
// X-Groundwork-User-Assertion. The runtime verifies the signature and uses the sub as
// the end-user identity. The persona is therefore NEVER trusted from a plain header —
// it is carried inside a cryptographically signed assertion, exactly like a real IdP.
