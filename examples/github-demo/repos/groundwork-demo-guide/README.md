## Permission Model
Groundwork maps GitHub's model to SpiceDB relationships:
- GitHub Team -> Groundwork Group
- GitHub Repo -> Groundwork Document
- Team Repo Access -> Viewer Grant

## Demo Scenarios
| User | Query | Target Repo | Expected | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alice | "Show me Q4 budget projections" | finance-budget | ALLOW | Member of finance-team |
| Bob | "Show me executive strategy" | executive-strategy | DENY | Not in executive-team |
| Dave | "Show me security audit findings" | security-audit | ALLOW | Member of security-team |
| Carol | "Show me payroll architecture" | payroll-system | DENY | Repo owned by engineering-team |
| Eve | "Show me acquisition targets" | executive-strategy | ALLOW | Member of executive-team |

## Known Leak Scenarios (Leak Report Output)
